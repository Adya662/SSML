# Amazon Polly Output Catalogue

This folder contains generated audio samples from **Amazon Polly** using different voices, engines, and input styles (plain text vs SSML).
It serves as a catalogue to compare how each configuration sounds, so you can choose the best for your use case.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

### 1. `baseline/`
A small **control sample** to confirm Polly is working before generating every possible voice.

- **plain_<Voice>_<Engine>.mp3**
  Plain text narration (`TEXT_INPUT`), no SSML tags.
- **ssml_<Voice>_<Engine>.mp3**
  SSML narration (`SSML_INPUT`) with prosody, emphasis, pauses, etc.

Example:

baseline/
plain_Joanna_neural.mp3   ‚Üê Joanna voice, Neural engine, plain text
ssml_Joanna_neural.mp3    ‚Üê Joanna voice, Neural engine, SSML-enhanced

---

### 2. `grid/`
The **full sweep**: all available voices + engines for the chosen language code (`GRID_LANGUAGE_CODE` in script).
Each voice/engine pair has both a plain text and SSML version.

Structure:

grid/
neural/
Joanna/
text_Joanna_neural.mp3   ‚Üê Plain text
ssml_Joanna_neural.mp3   ‚Üê SSML
Matthew/
text_Matthew_neural.mp3
ssml_Matthew_neural.mp3
standard/
Brian/
text_Brian_standard.mp3
ssml_Brian_standard.mp3

File naming convention:

text_.mp3   ‚Üí Plain text version
ssml_.mp3   ‚Üí SSML version

---

### 3. Special Category Folders (optional / extra)

Depending on Polly features and test runs, you may also see:

- `generative/` ‚Äì Files generated with Polly's generative preview voices (if available in your AWS region).
- `long-form/` ‚Äì Files from Polly's long-form TTS mode for very long scripts.
- `neural/` ‚Äì Direct output of neural engine runs (similar to `grid/neural`).
- `standard/` ‚Äì Direct output of standard engine runs (similar to `grid/standard`).

These may have been created from separate test runs or manual organisation.

## üîç How to Use This Catalogue

1. Start with `baseline/`
   Listen to both plain and SSML for your chosen voice/engine to confirm SSML formatting and that AWS Polly is working.

2. Explore `grid/`
   Browse by engine (`neural` for more natural tone, `standard` for wider SSML support).
   Compare plain text vs SSML in the same voice to hear the effect of prosody and emphasis.

3. Check special folders (if present)
   - `generative/` ‚Üí Try Polly's experimental AI voices.
   - `long-form/` ‚Üí For audiobooks, long scripts, or consistent delivery over minutes.
   - `neural/` and `standard/` ‚Üí Alternative organisation if you want to focus on one engine type.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Terminology

- Voice: Named persona in Polly (e.g., Joanna, Matthew, Amy).
- Engine:
  - `standard` ‚Äì Classic TTS engine. Supports most SSML tags.
  - `neural` ‚Äì Higher-quality, natural-sounding speech. Some SSML tags (especially Amazon-specific ones) are not supported.
  - `generative` (if available) ‚Äì New AI-based voices with more expressiveness.
- SSML: Speech Synthesis Markup Language. Controls speech rate, pitch, pauses, emphasis, and more.
- Plain Text: Raw text without SSML formatting.

---

## üìä Tips for Comparing Voices

- Listen to plain text first to get a baseline of the voice quality.
- Then listen to SSML version of the same voice/engine to hear how well it responds to prosody and emphasis.
- Neural voices are often smoother, but may ignore unsupported SSML tags.
- Standard voices have wider SSML compatibility but can sound less natural.

## üìù Script Config Recap

From the script‚Äôs top-level variables:

- `BASELINE_VOICE` ‚Äì Voice used in the baseline folder.
- `BASELINE_ENGINE` ‚Äì Engine used in the baseline folder.
- `GRID_LANGUAGE_CODE` ‚Äì Language for the grid search (e.g., `en-US`).
- `DO_GRID` ‚Äì Whether to run the full grid output.

If you want, I can also generate a CSV index that lists every file in this catalogue with:
- Voice name
- Engine
- File path
- Gender
- Language

That way you can sort and filter in Excel before listening.
